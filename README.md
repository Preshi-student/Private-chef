Menu Master: 

The Menu Master application is a mobile app designed for the private chef known as Christoffel for his personal culinary services.  The app has been designed to efficiently track and manage 
menu items across various courses.  Built using React Native and TypeScript, the app ensures data integrity,  provides real-time menu overview analytics,  and includes robust input validation courses. 

For part 3, I had to separate the screens so navigation was available.  That means including buttons and also a picker. 

Unique features:

Feature 1:   Navigation. Navigation was present, therefore allowing for the separation of screens 
Feature 2:  Important buttons that are able to go from one screen to another with ease. 
Feature 3:  The picker.  For the menu management screen a picker was used here to fill in the details for each dish according to name, description, price and course.

Like part 1 and part 2, the languages used here were React Native and Typescript.  Whereby React Native was used for the main framework for cross-platform mobile development which can 
be compatible across multiple devices. 

Then typescript was used for type safety.
